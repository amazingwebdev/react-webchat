# MSBotChat

Sample chat app for the [Microsoft Bot Framework](http://www.botframework.com) using the [DirectLine](http://docs.botframework.com/sdkreference/restapi-directline/) API.

## How real is this?

Rapidly-evolving proof of concept. Not currently supported or in any way production-ready. Questions and comments to [billba@microsoft.com](mailto:billba@microsoft.com). Please don't submit pull requests unless we have previously discussed it.

I keep [notes](./notes.md) reflecting my current thinking. I try to keep them reasonably up to date.  

## Install, Build, Run

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install`
3. `webpack -watch`
4. Start a local web server (I used http-server) and aim your browser at localhost.
